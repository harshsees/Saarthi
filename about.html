    <h2>🩸 Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Saarthi is a hyperlocal blood donation platform designed to connect donors and recipients

    <h2>🤖 How Technology Powers Saarthi</h2>
    <p>
      Saarthi integrates web technologies and machine learning models to intelligently
      prioritize donors. Our system evaluates donor availability, response history,
      and location proximity to recommend the most responsive donors during emergencies.

  <div class="about-card">
    <h2>🚨 The Problem We Solve</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional blood donation systems often rely on static information, manual
      coordination, or limited blood bank inventories. In critical situations,
      delays in finding donors can be life-threatening. Saarthi bridges this gap
      by enabling real-time, two-sided interaction between donors and recipients.
